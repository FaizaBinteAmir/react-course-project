## How I managed the state in this projects: 

In React, state is a way to store and manage data that can change over time within a component. It allows us to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

In this project, I used React useState hook couple of times to store data sometimes an Array, sometimes an object, sometimes a simple value.

While storing the data, I set up the initial value of those states according to the requirment of components.

And finally I passed the data to the functions set for each state which allows data to be displayed later on.
